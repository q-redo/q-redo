# Q2 - DevMountain Educational Communications Interface

## Getting Started

There are three types of users: student, mentor, and admin. Admin accounts can assign new user types as well as assign students and mentors to different classes.

Students can ask questions, post related code, and pick a question topic. Once a question is posted, both students and mentors can post answers to that question. Each posted question will become a "thread", with multiple users having the ability to answer the same question. 

Answers follow a scoring system, and users can upvote/downvote answers appropriately. The student who posted the respective question may choose a "Best Answer" for answers that are verified to have worked (similar to StackOverflow). Only active questions are visible on the main view, but all questions are archived into the database.
